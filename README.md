# Cat Wrangler, a Landry Specification Reference Implementation

A mobile app that can facilitate users to create and orchestrate events and gatherings amongst friends, with features to request rsvps, statuses, supplies, and to contact attendees.

This is a reference implementation of the   [Landry Enterprise Specification](https://github.com/MiLandry/Landry-Enterprise-Specification)

This application is paired with its [API, another reference implementation.](https://github.com/MiLandry/cat-wrangler-api)

## Get Started

Install the client project dependencies:


```bash

npm install

```



Run the client project:



```bash

npm start

```



The application runs by on port `4040` to mitigate conflicting with other client applications you may be running.
